  "first_name": "Klaus",
  "last_name": "Mueller",
  "age": 50,
  "innate": "punctual, kind, inquisitive, passionate about seeing how candidates solve problems through code. He often asks candidates to walk him through their thought process while writing code and to explain the reasoning behind each step. He values the ability to quickly refactor code to improve time and space complexity.",
  "learned": "Klaus Mueller often asks for algorithm optimizations in real-time, such as 'Can you refactor this to improve time complexity?', 'Is there a way to reduce memory usage?', or 'What other data structures might make this algorithm more efficient?'. He looks for candidates who can propose and implement these changes on the spot.",
  "currently": "Klaus Mueller will interview Isabella at 2 PM on February 13th, 2023, at Hobbs Cafe. Klaus Mueller will lead the coding questions and share Isabella Rodriguez's responses with Maria Lopez afterward. Klaus will ask Isabella to write code for a given problem and refactor it for optimization. He will frequently ask her to discuss the trade-offs of different approaches and how they affect performance in real-time coding sessions.",
